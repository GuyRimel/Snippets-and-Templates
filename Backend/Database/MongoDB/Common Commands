// MongoDB uses a "non-relational" database approach which is more flexible
// compared to SQL which uses "tables" with "primary/foreign keys"
// Mongo (a Non Relational database) uses "collections" of "documents"
// a "collection" is like a folder, a "document" is like a ... file in a folder. (which are actually JS/JSON objects)

// Here are some basic CRUD operations with Mongo (CLI):


// CREATE //////////
// db.createCollection("collectionName")
// db.collectionName.insertOne(document_being_inserted)
// note: declare a variable that is a JS or JSON object, then add the variable name into the ...insertOne(varName) method


// READ ////////////
// db.movies.find() // this finds all documents in the "movies" collection

// finding the first movie that meets a condition:
// db.movies.findOne( { _id: ObjectId("5c3bd189515a081b363cb7e4") } )


// UPDATE //////////
// $set is super important! otherwise this would overwrite the entire document with just a "description"
// db.[Collection Name].update( [Condition for which records to update], [Update to make] )
// db.movies.update(
//   { _id: ObjectId("5c3bd189515a081b363cb7e4") },
//   { $set: { Description: "A young FBI cadet must receive the help of an incarcerated and manipulative cannibal killer." } }
// )

// or add a NEW object to the object with $push:
// db.[collectionName].update(
//   [condition of which items to update],
//   { $push: { name of key to add value to end of array] : [value to add to end of array ] } }
// )

// db.users.update(
//   { Username: "Lilly" },
//   { $push: { FavoriteMovies: ObjectId("5c3bd189515a081b363cb7e4") } }
// )


// DELETE //////////
// db.[collectionName].deleteOne( [condition] )
// db.[collectionName].deleteMany([condition])
// db.movies.deleteMany({ "Genre.Name": "Comedy" }) // would delete all documents with a genre.name of "Comedy"
